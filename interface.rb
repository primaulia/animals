# Define an Animal with an initialize(name) constructor, exposing its name.
# create a new class file for this
# Implement a #talk instance method which returns a sentence like "Simba roars"
# for each animal. (Hint: Meerkats bark and Warthog grunt)

# Implement a ::phyla class method which will return an array of the four phyla
# of the animal kingdom.

# Add an #eat(food) instance method in Animal which returns a sentence like
# "Timon eats a scorpion". Then override this method for the Lion class,
# and return a sentence like "Simba eats a gazelle. Law of the Jungle!"

# Define three Lion, Meerkat and Warthog classes in the interface
# In another Ruby file, create an array with Simba, Nala, Timon & Pumbaa, iterate over it and puts the sound each animal make
